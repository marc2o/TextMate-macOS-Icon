# Alternative Icon for TextMate

I just wanted TextMate to look more Monterey-ish in my Dock. And I had tons of fun drawing the flower.

You can find [TextMate here on GitHub](https://github.com/textmate/textmate).

Made with [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (source file is included).

Create the .icns file from the iconset folder on macOS using the terminal:

	iconutil -c icns /path/to/TextMate.iconset
